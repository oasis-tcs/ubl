Crane-gc2obdndr.xsl - 20210607-1250z

This is a stylesheet to generate the validation artefacts (XSD schemas and
CVA assertions) described by a document described by a CCTS model expressed
using genericode. The version of NDR implemented by these stylesheets is
found at:

  http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-NDR/v3.0/UBL-NDR-v3.0.html

For best results the Crane-gcublndrcheck-obfuscated.xsl stylesheet should be
used to analyze the genericode file expressing the CCTS model.  Doing so will
highlight changes to make to prevent certain nonsensical results when
generating the artefacts.

Please see "CreatingExtensionsWithUBLNDR.html" for an illustration of using
these stylesheets

This documentation and the URI resolution of the XSLT processor both presume
the use of the free Saxon9HE XSLT processor from http://saxon.sf.net ... if
that XSLT 2.0 processor is not being used, then the results may not be as
expected.

Typical invocation:

  java -jar saxon9he.jar {arguments}

Mandatory invocation arguments (URIs are relative to input genericode file):

 - stylesheet file:                         -xsl:Crane-gc2obdndr-obfuscated.xsl
 - input genericode file                    -s:{filename}
 - placebo output in target directory       -o:{dir}/junk.out
 - configuration detail file                config-uri={filename}

Optional invocation arguments:

 - only minimum subset of all models        subset-result={no(default)/yes}
   - this prunes away ABIEs that are never used by any model
 - a particular subset of some models       subset-model-regex={string}
 - a particular subset of some constructs   subset-column-name={string-no-sp}
   - the genericode column short name (no white-space), typically compressed
     from the spreadsheet column name
 - lazy pruning of the model                subset-absent-is-zero={no(def)/yes}
   - this only applies to items that have a minimum cardinality of 0; to
     preserve the item the original cardinality must be included in the subset
 - document the exclusion of items          subset-exclusions={yes(default)/no}
 - include elements for all types    subset-include-type-elements={yes(def)/no}
   - this allows one to ignore OBDNDR DCL04
 - include ignored types             subset-include-ignored-types={yes(def)/no}
   - this will suppress declarations that are not needed because not referenced
 - skip creation of QDT fragment            skip-qdt={no(default)/yes}
   - (deprecated) creating a QDT fragment according to the NDRs must be skipped
     if one has already been created with the desired qualifications that are
     differently declared than according to the NDRs
 - add extension point to every ABIE     extensions-for-abies={no(default)/yes}

Optional invocation arguments (URIs are relative to input genericode file):
(only used when creating extensions or additional documents)

 - config file for base vocabulary          base-config-uri={filename}
 - genericode file for base vocabulary      base-gc-uri={filename}

Necessary invocation argument when the common library has exactly one ABIE:

 - specify the model name          common-library-singleton-model-name={string}

Deprecated invocation argument to mimic archaic declarations:

 - mimic UBL 2.1 declarations              qdt-for-UBL-2.1-only={no(def)/yes}
   - this property should only be used when recreating schemas from before
     the release of the OASIS Business Document Naming and Design Rules
   - this is not to be used in the normal course of creating schemas

Example invocations:

To create the UBL 2.1 base vocabulary artefacts:

Configuration details file:

The configuration file has two major sections, the <ndr> section and the 
<schema> section.

The <ndr> section describes properties of the use of the naming and design 
rules, such as abbreviations, equivalences, expected BIEs and data types.  This
information is not used in the schema generation.  See the documentation for 
the NDR checking program for details.

The <schema> section describes all of the directories and files that are 
created or files that are needed by the files that are created as part of 
schema generation. The file types are indicated using the type= attribute. The
files that are created are:

    CVA - created context/value association file
        - there are as many of these entries as CVA files need to be created
        - each CVA file points to a skeleton CVA file in which <Context> 
          elements have ignored address= attributes that are each replaced 
          with a valid address= attribute of the union of all BBIE elements, 
          by name using the BBIE namespace prefix, that use the given 
          qualified data type as in these two examples:
          <Context values="checkMax" address="">
             <Annotation>
               <AppInfo>
                 <c:DataType>Max_ Numeric. Type</c:DataType>
               </AppInfo>
             </Annotation>
          </Context>
          <Context values="Chip-2.0" metadata="cctsV2.01-code" address="">
            <Annotation>
              <AppInfo>
                <c:DataType>Chip_ Code. Type</c:DataType>
              </AppInfo>
            </Annotation>
          </Context>
  SABIE - created supplemental library ABIE schema file
  SBBIE - created supplemental library BBIE schema file
  XABIE - created extension point ABIE schema file
  AABIE - created additional document ABIE schema file
  CABIE - created common library ABIE schema file
  CBBIE - created common library BBIE schema file
  DABIE - created document ABIE schema file
        - there are as many of these DABIE entries as document schemas need to 
          be created
        - when supplemental/extension/additional schema files are being 
          created, and only one set of such schema files can be created in any 
          given execution, the common schema files are not created
        - when the element name is <file>, a single file is created with the 
          given file name
        - when the element name is <files>, all document ABIE files are 
          created using the name and namespace as a substitution pattern
    DOC - documentation namespace (no actual file)
    EXT - referenced extension content file (optional)
        - the child of this entry is an XSD reference to the extension point 
          to be included in every document schema as the first child of the 
          document element 

A common comment can be defined for all files for which a specific comment is 
not provided. This comment is placed at the start of the file created. There 
are a number of substitution variables available for this comment:

    %% - a single percent sign
    %f - the output filename (with config path)
    %n - the output ABIE name (no config path)
    %t - the local time of file creation
    %z - the UTC (Zulu) time of file creation

The configuration file is organized by multiple directory parent elements that 
are used to calculate relative URI references for XSD import directives. There 
need not be any directory entries. The directory entry with the attribute 
runtime-name= triggers the recreation of the suite of contained files in the 
given alternative directory, but with XSD documentation constructs removed.

The configuration file used for UBL 2.1 is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE configuration
[
<!ENTITY versionDisplay "2.1 OS">
<!ENTITY versionDirectory   "os-UBL-2.1">
<!ENTITY versionDate        "04 November 2013">
]>
<configuration xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
